5,324837,Inspired Cannabis Co - Nanaimo,"Inspired Cannabis Co is a family-run business whose mission is to plant roots within the communities we operate, and support local businesses and families whenever possible. Family is paramount; it is a priceless legacy of resources, inspiration and expertise. The depth of our roots allows us to look confidently ahead. Without this knowledge and understanding, it would not be possible to steer the company in the direction of our best future.

We are a licensed cannabis retail company with our first store opened in Courtenay, BC. We have opened our second store at 1710 Robson Street and our third store in Nanaimo, BC. As licensed stores in the new legal market, our goal is to set a standard for cannabis retail by redefining the experience of purchasing cannabis and helping dissolve the negative stigma associated with the industry.

We are building our stores to be positive, open, and welcoming. When you walk into an Inspired Cannabis Co store, we want you to feel as welcome as you would in your family’s home.

We offer a broad, curated range of cannabis products from established growers. Inspired Cannabis is here to help the seasoned connoisseur, or a curious new-comer, find or recommend the right cannabis product.
