2,304388,Lake City Cannabis,"Lake City Cannabis is Chestermere's first approved cannabis dispensary. Nestled just 10 minutes from Calgary on Chestermere Lake, our store is curated to your experience. 

Lake City Cannabis is family owned and operated by Ryan and Chelsea Roch. Their love and passion for cannabis runs deep, and educating customers is their focus. When Cannabis was legalized in Canada on October 17th, 2018, the need for education became more important than ever. Lake Citys goal is to provide extensive product knowledge in a relaxed open atmosphere.

Lake City Cannabis is also very committed to giving back to the community. We offer educational programs to community group and non-profits. We also regularly look to support local causes and initiative in whatever ways possible through community profit sharing. Our Dispensary takes cash, credit and debit to fit your requirements.

We look forward to meeting you!
