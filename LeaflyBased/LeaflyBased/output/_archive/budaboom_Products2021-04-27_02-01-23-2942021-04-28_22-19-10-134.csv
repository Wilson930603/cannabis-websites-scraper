It's the result of combining Slurricane Pheno #7, known for its intense frosty qualities with Slurricane Pheno #44, reputably the most flavorful! A cross between Do-Si-Dos (OG Kush Breath and Face Off OG) and Purple Punch (Larry OG and Granddaddy Purple), these buds grow with beautifully dark fan leaves, deep purple tones and bright orange pistils. These sparkling buds are known for their creamy caramel coffee, grassy and sweet scents. The flavour resembles a lavender honey milkshake that hits you in your chest before gradually moving up to your eyes. These two 0.5g pre-rolls use Konehedz cones and filters, and are hand finished by our highly trained staff (who are fellow consumers) in Sundre, AB. They're gently placed in their packaging for minimal agitation. All Slurricane product is grown, harvested and processed with precision in our state-of-the-art purpose-built facility.
