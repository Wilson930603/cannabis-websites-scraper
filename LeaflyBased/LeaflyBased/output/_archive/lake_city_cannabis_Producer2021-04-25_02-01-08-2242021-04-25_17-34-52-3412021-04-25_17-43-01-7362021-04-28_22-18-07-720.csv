0,304388,Lake City Cannabis,"Lake City Cannabis is Chestermere's first approved cannabis dispensary. Nestled just 10 minutes from Calgary on Chestermere Lake, our store is curated to your experience. 

Lake City Cannabis is family owned and operated by Ryan and Chelsea Roch. Their love and passion for cannabis runs deep, and educating customers is their focus. When Cannabis was legalized in Canada on October 17th, 2018, the need for education became more important than ever. Lake Citys goal is to provide extensive product knowledge in a relaxed open atmosphere.

Lake City Cannabis is also very committed to giving back to the community. We offer educational programs to community group and non-profits. We also regularly look to support local causes and initiative in whatever ways possible through community profit sharing. Our Dispensary takes cash, credit and debit to fit your requirements.

We look forward to meeting you!

5,324837,Inspired Cannabis Co - Nanaimo,"Inspired Cannabis Co is a family-run business whose mission is to plant roots within the communities we operate, and support local businesses and families whenever possible. Family is paramount; it is a priceless legacy of resources, inspiration and expertise. The depth of our roots allows us to look confidently ahead. Without this knowledge and understanding, it would not be possible to steer the company in the direction of our best future.

We are a licensed cannabis retail company with our first store opened in Courtenay, BC. We have opened our second store at 1710 Robson Street and our third store in Nanaimo, BC. As licensed stores in the new legal market, our goal is to set a standard for cannabis retail by redefining the experience of purchasing cannabis and helping dissolve the negative stigma associated with the industry.

We are building our stores to be positive, open, and welcoming. When you walk into an Inspired Cannabis Co store, we want you to feel as welcome as you would in your family’s home.

We offer a broad, curated range of cannabis products from established growers. Inspired Cannabis is here to help the seasoned connoisseur, or a curious new-comer, find or recommend the right cannabis product.
