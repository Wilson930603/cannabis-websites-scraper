0,306297,FivePoint Cannabis,"100% Locally Owned and Operated
We sell weed and showcase local art. 

       Here at FivePoint we're passionate about Canadian cannabis, and our mission is to support local economy. We purchase small production, Canadian made goods. Not only will you find a curated list of some of Canada's best bud, concentrates, edibles, beverages and vapes but you will find lots of custom glass, one-of-a-kind accessories not available anywhere else, and Canadian made products.

     We are committed to supporting local art in the FivePoint gallery space. Featured exhibitions of paintings, sculptures and furniture contribute to a laid-back and creative atmosphere focused on community and education. It is our goal to continue to make measurable impacts for local artists.

     When you purchase products at FivePoint, your money is directly going back to local artists in your community, and your dollars are being reinvested back into Canadian companies. Shop local, enjoy art, smoke good weed. That's what we care about, too.",https://www.fivepointbridgeland.com/,,Calgary,Alberta,FivePoint Cannabis,T2E 9E1,-114.0407904,51.052975,,https://www.leafly.com/dispensary-info/fivepoint-cannabis,,https://leafly-production.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fleafly-images%2Fmenu%2FU6djInHT82dxLtw6TylI_IMG_1738.JPG?ixlib=js-2.3.2&dpr=1&w=1100&h=750&fit=fillmax&s=827cee5e6d53b814bfafa039b1e0707f,https://leafly-production.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fleafly-images%2Fmenu%2FU6djInHT82dxLtw6TylI_IMG_1738.JPG?ixlib=js-2.3.2&dpr=3&w=1100&h=750&fit=fillmax&s=43edca0f4c49c2dbc58b43fc34e1d6e0,https://leafly-production.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fleafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fdispensary%2Fphotos%2F92EdTjkATj2OaLG9vQ2t_2J2A0763.JPG?ixlib=js-2.3.2&dpr=3&w=1100&h=750&fit=fillmax&s=49593c674939fef19d6d555e362e3cd3,https://leafly-production.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fleafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fdispensary%2Fphotos%2FUWeTIut8SCesWvjfS4UX_Back%2520of%2520Card%2520in%2520Greenery.jpg?ixlib=js-2.3.2&dpr=3&w=1100&h=750&fit=fillmax&s=a097a8685bde8d01b450e283c4440975,https://leafly-production.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fleafly-public.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fdispensary%2Fphotos%2FWR0aGd0oSvOpu5vPqK1r_2J2A0008.JPG?ixlib=js-2.3.2&dpr=3&w=1100&h=750&fit=fillmax&s=f8e251130265250de494e1748e9f7600,dispensary,,,(403) 690-3636,,,,admin@fivepointcannabis.ca,,,945 General Ave NE,,,,
